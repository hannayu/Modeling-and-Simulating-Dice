# Modeling-and-Simulating-Dice
Midterm Project for MATH-UA 395 (Special Topics: Modeling and Simulation in Science, Engineering, and Economics) at NYU in Fall 2020. 

We simulate throwing a cube on the ground by modeling the object as a rigid body. We model both translational motion and rotational motion in three dimensions, taking into account forces exerted by the ground's friction, stiffness, and damping. We found from our simulation that to maintain numerical stability, increasing the stiffness of the ground requires decreasing the step size of our numerical scheme.
