# Modeling-and-Simulating-Dice
We simulate throwing a cube on the ground by modeling the object as a rigid body. The model tracks translational motion and rotational motion in three dimensions, taking into account forces exerted by the ground's friction, stiffness, and damping. Results from the simulation show that to maintain numerical stability, increasing the stiffness of the ground requires decreasing the step size of our numerical scheme.

This was a midterm project for MATH-UA 395 (Special Topics: Modeling and Simulation in Science, Engineering, and Economics) at New York University in Fall 2020.
